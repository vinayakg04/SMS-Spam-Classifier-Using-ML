# 📩 SMS Spam Classifier using Machine Learning

A supervised machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and popular classification algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust spam detection system using a dataset of labeled SMS messages. It involves cleaning and vectorizing text data, followed by training multiple ML models to identify spam messages with high accuracy.
